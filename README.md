## Description
This project implements an AI agent that learns to play the game 2048 using N-tuple networks and temporal difference learning, inspired by **published research**.

## How it works?
- something for short and mostly about 
    - ntuple network
    - td agent

## Scripts
- photo of how the message looks after 1000 trained episodes?
- where are the models saved, how theyre loaded
- training options
- gym, rewards etc 
- talk about each py file basically

## Research
- link the research page here and some words about it.
